                <h2>Smartphone</h2>

                <p>A smartphone is a portable device that combines mobile telephone and computing functions into one
                    unit. They are distinguished from feature phones by their stronger hardware capabilities and
                    extensive mobile operating systems, which facilitate wider software, internet (including web
                    browsing over mobile broadband), and multimedia functionality (including music, video, cameras,
                    and
                    gaming), alongside core phone functions such as voice calls and text messaging. Smartphones
                    typically contain a number of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) integrated circuit (IC) chips,
                    include
                    various sensors that can be leveraged by pre-included and third-party software (such as a
                    magnetometer, proximity sensors, barometer, gyroscope, accelerometer and more), and support
                    wireless
                    communications protocols (such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or satellite navigation).<br><br>

                    Early smartphones were marketed primarily towards the enterprise market, attempting to bridge the
                    functionality of standalone personal digital assistant (PDA) devices with support for cellular
                    telephony, but were limited by their bulky form, short battery life, slow analog cellular networks,
                    and the immaturity
                    of wireless data services. These issues were eventually resolved with the exponential scaling and
                    miniaturization of MOS transistors down to sub-micron levels (Moore's law), the improved lithium-ion
                    battery, faster digital mobile data networks (Edholm's law), and more mature software platforms that
                    allowed mobile device ecosystems to develop independently of data providers.<br><br>

                    In the 2000s, NTT DoCoMo's i-mode platform, BlackBerry, Nokia's Symbian platform, and Windows Mobile
                    began to gain market traction, with models often featuring QWERTY keyboards or resistive touchscreen
                    input, and emphasizing access to push email and wireless internet. Following the rising popularity
                    of the iPhone in the late 2000s, the majority of smartphones have featured thin, slate-like form
                    factors, with large, capacitive screens with support for multi-touch gestures rather than physical
                    keyboards, and offer the ability for users to download or purchase additional applications from a
                    centralized store, and use cloud storage and synchronization, virtual assistants, as well as mobile
                    payment services. Smartphones have largely replaced PDAs and handheld/palm-sized PCs.<br><br>

                    Improved hardware and faster wireless communication (due to standards such as LTE) have bolstered
                    the growth of the smartphone industry. In the third quarter of 2012, one billion smartphones were in
                    use worldwide. Global smartphone sales surpassed the sales figures for feature phones in early 2013.
