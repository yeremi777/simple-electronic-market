                <p>A smartphone is a portable device that combines mobile telephone and computing functions into one
                    unit. They are distinguished from feature phones by their stronger hardware capabilities and
                    extensive mobile operating systems, which facilitate wider software, internet (including web
                    browsing over mobile broadband), and multimedia functionality (including music, video, cameras,
                    and
                    gaming), alongside core phone functions such as voice calls and text messaging. Smartphones
                    typically contain a number of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) integrated circuit (IC) chips,
                    include
                    various sensors that can be leveraged by pre-included and third-party software (such as a
                    magnetometer, proximity sensors, barometer, gyroscope, accelerometer and more), and support
                    wireless
                    communications protocols (such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or satellite navigation).</p>

                <p>A laptop, laptop computer, or notebook computer is a small, portable personal computer (PC) with
                    a
                    screen and alphanumeric keyboard. These typically have a "clamshell" form factor, typically
                    having
                    the screen mounted on the inside of the upper lid and the keyboard on the inside of the lower
                    lid,
                    although 2-in-1 PCs with a detachable keyboard are often marketed as laptops or as having a
                    "laptop
                    mode." Laptops are folded shut for transportation, and thus are suitable for mobile use.[1] Its
                    name
                    comes from lap, as it was deemed practical to be placed on a person's lap when being used.
                    Today,
                    laptops are the used in a variety of settings, such as at work, in education, for playing games,
                    web
                    browsing, for personal multimedia, and general home computer use.</p>

                <p>A voucher is a bond of the redeemable transaction type which is worth a certain monetary value
                    and
                    which may be spent only for specific reasons or on specific goods. Examples include housing,
                    travel,
                    and food vouchers. The term voucher is also a synonym for receipt and is often used to refer to
                    receipts used as evidence of, for example, the declaration that a service has been performed or
                    that
                    an expenditure has been made. Voucher is a tourist guide for using services with a guarantee of
                    payment by the agency.</p>
